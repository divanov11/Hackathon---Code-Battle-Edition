## 11 - EZRecommend (Saphal Patro)

**Marketing Pitch**

> Modern recruiting practices are broken. Most interview processes rely on a day-long interview. Such an interview practice is not the best way to evaluate a candidate. In my opinion, it is a much better idea to have an entire arsenal of people to back up your skills. Hence, the solution is obviously to rely on recommendations from your coworkers, colleagues as well as managers. However, writing detailed recommendations is time consuming and is usually very specific to a particular job role. I believe providing smaller and more generic recommendations is the right way to go about recruitment. Having a large number of recommendations explaining your expertise is a much better way to go, as a lot of people would vouch for the skills you have as opposed to having only 2-3 people who can speak to your skills.
