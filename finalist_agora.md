## 5 - RapidMeet (Alexander Garzo)

**Marketing Pitch**

> Did you know that video meeting calls will be a $13.8 billion market by 2023? (ReportBuyer) But it seems being that no one cares about disrupting employee productivity with extra long meetings, and worse still causing a cost of more than $1,250 per employee per month in lost time (Wundamail). So that's why we created RapidMeet, with a call duration exactly as scheduled and a 5-minute extension if and only if everyone in the room agrees.

## 6 - Hourglass (Daniel Eta)

**Marketing Pitch**

> I built Hourglass, a productivity meeting website that helps users to take charge of their time by setting more rigid meeting periods. If the time elapses, all parties have to mutually consent to having an incremented period. Statistics are also stored so that users can see each others meeting data and perhaps optimize that for evaluation etc.

## 8 - Meetner (Tobiloba Adedeji)


**Marketing Pitch**

> Meetner is a meeting/collaboration solution to that will improve the virtual experiences of people in meetings.
Most virtual collaboration platforms do not give hosts and audiences distributed controls that Meetener offers like:
1. The timer feature used to segment and order meeting agenda
2. Scheduling just took a whole new dimension when it comes to organizing virtual meetups  with a specific goal in mind by the host and the members alike.
3. The platform gives the opportunity to be time conscious when it comes to deliberating on various topics featured in meetups.

## 10 - Sensible  (Ashish Pandagre)

**Marketing Pitch**

> This app will allow users to create instant meetings and have group discussions for a particular agenda, but if someone wants to extend time or say something which might be a concern for only a few people in that meeting, so they can instantly ask them to join a quick another meeting after this. ONly the users who accept the extend request will join that meeting. This way only concerned people will join and other people can just leave after this meeting
